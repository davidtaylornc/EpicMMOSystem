EpicMMOSystem

This is a fork to fix the problems in the grouping and party system introduced with Valheim crossplay.  I also fixed some bugs in the API code.  

I use VS2019, so I had to convert every instance of file scope namespace to bracket scope namespace.  If that bothers you, change it back.

Use this fork for anything you like, subject to the original author's license.
